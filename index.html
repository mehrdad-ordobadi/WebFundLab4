        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
          I am originally from Tehran, Iran. I have lived in three countries:
          Iran, Germany, and currently I call Canada home. I was born in 1989
          which makes me an 80's (and 90's kis)! I am passionate about music,
          books, and food amongst other things.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently a student in BCIT studying in the program CIT. I found
          the program <em>very</em> intense but useful. In case you are
          wondering how I look like, I have included a picture of me in this
          page. Furthermore, you can see names of three courses I take in this
          program in the courses link above.
